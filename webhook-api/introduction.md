Hi, Developer!

You can use webhooks to receive notifications, such as conversation replies, and users being created. Notifications are grouped into events which can be subscribed to.

The main events for the webhook API are subscriptions, login, chat accept, offline, chat messages and chat close notifications.

 **Note** : You can view, edit and troubleshoot all your webhooks from the acquire webhooks dashboard.
