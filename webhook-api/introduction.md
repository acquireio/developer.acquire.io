# Introduction

The webhooks will assist you to subscribe to real-time HTTP notification of changes to specific objects that occur during an Acquire account with a configured endpoint. Instead of making an API call during an event that occurs in the account, Acquire can send a request to the endpoint you configure.

{% hint style="info" %}
 **Note**: The Settings section has the option to view, update and log all your webhooks from the Acquire webhooks dashboard.
