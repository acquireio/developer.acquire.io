# Introduction

Instead of making an API call during an event, Acquire can send a request to the endpoint you configured. Respond with dynamic data or record data in other platforms by using webhooks.

 **Note**: The Settings section has the option to view, update and log all your webhooks. In Acquire, go to **Settings &gt; For Developers &gt; Webhooks** to get started**.**
{% endhint %}

Learn more about using webhooks in chatbots in our [help docs article](https://help.acquire.io/for-developers/webhooks-for-chatbots).
