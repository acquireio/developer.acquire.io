### Add the latest stable SDK

**Add the latest stable SDK release to your project**

* Unzip the SDK & drag-drop `acquireIO.framework` files into your Xcode project.
* In `Build Phases`, verify that `AcquireIO.framework` is in the `Link Binary with Libraries` and the AcquireIO resources are in `Copy Bundle Resources`
* Add the following frameworks to `Link Binary with Libraries` -
  * `CoreFoundation`
  * `CoreGraphics`
  * `QuartzCore`
  * `UIKit`

**Explanation**: The AcquireIO SDK uses background mode `Audio` for when you are video/voice call to agent/visitor. If you have not enable then background voice will not work. When the `UIBackgroundModes` key contains the `audio` value, the systemâ€™s media frameworks automatically prevent the corresponding app from being suspended when it moves to the background. Go to `Project/Targets -> Capabilities -> Background Modes -> Audio, AirPlay (Check)`
{% endhint %}

For xcode 8 or later:

1. Go to Project/Targets -&gt; \[Project Name\] -&gt; Build Settings.
2. search `"ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES"`
3. click the right of Debug, and selected `'Other'`, input `"$(inherited)"`
4. do same with 'Release' and install your pod

Remember to write your description why you ask for this authorization, between `<string>` and `</string>`, or your app will be rejected by apple:
