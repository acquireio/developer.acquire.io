## API Reference

â€‹[Acquire](https://acquire.io/) is a headless support API that enables rapid experience-first all business development.

## Errors

Any request that returns an error follows a standard format. Acquire will return an array of `errors` that contains objects containing `status`, `title` and `details`.

You'll most likely receive an error if validation fails, something doesn't exist or something went wrong on our end. We return errors inline with the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/#error-objects).
