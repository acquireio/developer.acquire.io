# Getting Started

Welcome to Acquire's developer documentation. This document provides powerful resources for interacting with Acquire and explains how to use API and Webhooks. Please contact us at: [developer@acquire.io](mailto:developer@acquire.io)  
  
The Acquire Developer Portal enables you to utilize Acquire's real-time and historic conversation data, and communicate within your application. You'll find guides and community support to help you start working as quickly as possible!

## What do you want to do?

The [Acquire](https://acquire.io/) Developer Portal is divided into four different resources. These resources may be used to perform a wide range of tasks.
