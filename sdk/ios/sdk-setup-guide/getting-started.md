# Getting Started

AcquirIO SDK provides you with many helpful methods to build the chat and audio/video chat from the client-side.

This page presents a quick overview of the SDKâ€™s functionalities and logic, then lets you go through the easy steps of implementing AcquirIO SDK in your own app.

### Requirements

* iOS 11.0+
* XCode 11.4+

### Build variants

We are providing two types of build variants :

1. **Core** - Fully featured including Audio/Video calling. [See Integration](integration-guide-core.md)
2. **Lite** - All features excluding Audio/Video Calling. [See Integration](integration-guide-lite.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
So if you don't require calling feature, you can use **lite** version to reduce the app size.
{% endhint %}

You can use our native SDK in your project using [Cocoapods](integration-guide-core.md).
