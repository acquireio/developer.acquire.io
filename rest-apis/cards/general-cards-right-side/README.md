# Exclusive cards

These endpoints allow you to customize the Acquire UI by replacing custom cards. These cards are visible in the Dashboard as part of the app view in the right panel. 

Use exclusive cards when you want to display data inside Acquire, but JSON objects and UIs aren't relevant to your use case. You may customize the JSON object to your needs, or you may present the data using an iframe.

### Permissions
