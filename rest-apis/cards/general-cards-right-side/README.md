# Exclusive cards

This API allows extending the Acquire UI by replacing custom cards. These cards are mentioned on the dashboard as part of the app on the right, then requests to retrieve outer data when the contact is accessed by the agent.

You want to display your data inside Acquire, but no JSON object or UI is relevant to your necessity, so you can customize the JSON object relevant to your needs, or you can also present the data using an iframe.
