# Azure QnA Maker

The QnA Maker works with Natural Language Processing to understand and answer user questions. It enables bots to find the correct answer in your Knowledge Base and communicate it to users.  


Integrating the bot allows Acquire to use the questions and answers it's trained for in the Web Widget.
