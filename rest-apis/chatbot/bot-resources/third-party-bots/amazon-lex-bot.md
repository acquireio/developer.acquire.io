# Amazon Lex Bot

The Amazon Lex Bot is designed to provide lifelike conversations to users by understanding speech. This is possible via deep learning tech, like automatic speech recognition \(ASR\) and natural language understanding \(NLU\).  


Integrating the bot allows Acquire to use the questions and answers it's trained for in the Web Widget.
